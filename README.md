# ðŸŽ­ Impressive: Make your best impressions!

Impressive is a mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com) via [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) which adds support for [Steam Link's](https://store.steampowered.com/app/353380/Steam_Link/) passthrough of face tracking and eye tracking data.

# Installation

Firstly, impressive depends on [Re-Sounding](https://github.com/RileyGuy/Re-Sounding) (by yours truly), and [Rug.Osc](https://bitbucket.org/rugcode/rug.osc) (by rugcode). Both are included with the download of this mod for your convenience.

Make sure you've followed the installation instructions for ResoniteModLoader so that you can install Resonite mods.

Simply unzip the latest zip from releases and drop the "Resonite" folder, onto your own wherever you have Resonite installed. This will  move all of the prerequisite files to the locations that they need to be in.

You're done! Simply boot up Steam Link and set the OSC output port to "Direct (9000)" or in the event that it's renamed, the closest match. You want it to be on the direct mode so as not to use the wrong OSC bindings.
